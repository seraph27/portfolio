Welcome to my portfolio and blog! I'm Rex Chao, a Backend/ML Systems Engineer currently working at Lunabill, a Y Combinator F25 startup.

## What I Do

I specialize in building scalable systems and machine learning infrastructure. My work spans:

- **Machine Learning Engineering**: Optimizing ML pipelines, working with LLMs, ASR, and RAG systems
- **Backend Development**: Building robust APIs and data pipelines with TypeScript, Python, and PostgreSQL
- **Systems Design**: Creating scalable architectures that handle real-world production traffic

## Recent Highlights

Currently, I'm working on automating healthcare operations at Lunabill, where I built a call-record auditing classifier that processes 27k+ insurance calls with 80% accuracy, cutting manual audit costs by $1k/month.

Previously, I've:
- Developed a full-stack clinic management PWA handling $200k+ in transactions
- Optimized real-time voice agent pipelines at Foxconn, reducing latency by 25%
- Built an AI Japanese light-novel recommender using transformer embeddings and vector search

## Why This Blog?

I'm starting this blog to share insights from my work in ML systems, backend architecture, and competitive programming. Expect posts about:

- Performance optimization techniques
- ML infrastructure best practices
- System design patterns
- Competitive programming solutions
- Real-world engineering challenges and how I solved them
