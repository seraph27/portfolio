# Claude Rules for Rex Chao Portfolio

## Core Principles

1. **No Useless Files**: Do not create unnecessary `.md` files or any other files unless explicitly requested by the user.

2. **Strict Adherence**: Always follow these rules 100%. Do not deviate unless explicitly asked to change something.

3. **Respect User Style**: Never modify the user's:
   - Capitalization choices
   - Wording and phrasing
   - Writing style
   - Naming conventions
   
   If the user writes something in a specific way, preserve it exactly as written.

## Content Guidelines

- Only create, modify, or delete files when explicitly requested
- Preserve all existing style choices in code and content
- Do not "improve" or "fix" capitalization, grammar, or style unless specifically asked
- When making changes, match the existing patterns and conventions in the codebase

## Communication

- Be direct and efficient
- Focus on what was asked
- Don't suggest unrequested improvements to style or wording
- Assume the user's choices are intentional

## File Operations

- Never create documentation files without explicit request
- Don't add comments or documentation unless asked
- Respect the minimal, clean philosophy of the portfolio

**Remember**: The user knows what they want. Follow instructions precisely and respect their creative choices.
